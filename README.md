## Banner Markers (Built-in Feature)

- Players can create **Banner Markers** by placing banners with custom name in the world.
- Banner markers are automatically detected and shown in the GUI and on BlueMap.
- Each banner marker displays its color, name, location, and owner.
- Players can track/untrack banner markers as waypoints just like any other marker.
- Banner markers are persistent and integrated with the plugin's waypoint and display system.
