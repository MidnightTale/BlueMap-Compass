# BlueMap Compass Plugin

A Minecraft plugin that allows players to view and set waypoint to BlueMap markers through a custom GUI when right-clicking with a compass.

1. **Get a Compass**: Obtain any compass item (vanilla compass works)
2. **Right-Click**: Right-click with the compass in hand
3. **Browse Markers**: The GUI will show all available BlueMap markers
4. **Teleport**: Click on any marker to set waypoint tracker

## Banner Markers (Built-in Feature)

- Players can create **Banner Markers** by placing banners with custom name in the world.
- Banner markers are automatically detected and shown in the GUI and on BlueMap.
- Each banner marker displays its color, name, location, and owner.
- Players can track/untrack banner markers as waypoints just like any other marker.
- Banner markers are persistent and integrated with the plugin's waypoint and display system.
